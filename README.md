# SMS Spam Detector

This SMS spam detector uses a ReactJS frontend along with a FastAPI backend to allow users to enter messages they
receive to determine if it is spam or ham.

A classic Naive Bayes algorithm is implemented and is trained on a list of spam and ham messages
that have been cleaned and vectorized to yield a 98% accuracy.
